This is because of the way light interacts with the human eye's color receptors. In bright light, the light is scattered more evenly throughout the atmosphere, which affects the way colors are perceived. In contrast, in low light conditions, there is less scattering, which results in more of the shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) being scattered away, leaving mainly the longer wavelengths (like red and yellow) to reach the retina.
